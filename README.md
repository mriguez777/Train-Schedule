# Train-Schedule

Developer: Michael Rodriguez

Purpose: to create an app using local storage (Firebase).

This example: Train-Schedule app is intended to display creating a schedule and having it list out. The display will show the next available time depending on the first train time and frequency provided. A great use for this would be for a train company that wanted to display their train arrival times. 

How-To-Use:
1. Enter in a Train Name, Destination, First Train time in Military time, then Frequency the train will run. 
2. When submitted the app will automatically calculate when the next train will arrive and display that time. 

Technology used:
HTML, CSS, BootStrap, Firebase, jQuery, Moment.js

Both the image and the coded data is held on firebase. I wanted to test out the range of local storage firebase provides and it works out well if you need a platform for hosting images for a website if no server is present.
